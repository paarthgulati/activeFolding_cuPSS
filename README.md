# activeFolding_cuPSS

This is the pseduo spectral solver built atop the cuPSS library (arXiv:2405.02410) availabe at https://github.com/fcaballerop/cuPSS (v0.0.1) to solve continuum field equations for a mixture of active liquid crystals and a passive isotropic fluid in 2D on a regular lattice. 

Using the cuPSS library, we can solve generic stochastic PDEs. Here, I only include the solver (solvers/model_ALLPS_gravity) for the equations described below, as discussed in (link).

To use this solver, and the cuPSS library in general, the follwing dependencies are required:
- CUDA toolkit (11+)
- cuFFT
- cuRAND
- FFTW3

Once downloaded, you can compile the solver using the comp.sh file as:
```
comp.sh -s model_ALLPS_gravity
```

This compiles the solver "model_ALLPS_gravity" which will be used to solve the equations necessary to describe phase separation between an active and a passive fluid.

This can then be run using:
```
run/run_activeFolding.sh
```
This solves the following equations in 2D for the default parameters selected from solvers/model_ALLPS_gravity/default_parameters.txt and edited paramteres listed in run/run_activeFolding.sh

# Continuum model

The model is described in terms of a phase field $\phi$ describing the relative concentrations fo the two fluid phases, a nematic tensor field $Q$ describe the local orientation order, and a flow field $v$ as a Stokes flow generated by $\phi, Q$:

$$\partial_t \phi + v \cdot \nabla \phi = M \nabla^2 (a_\phi \phi + b_\phi \phi^3 + \kappa_\phi \nabla^2 \phi), $$

$$\partial_t Q = \lambda A  - \omega\cdot Q + Q\cdot \omega +\dfrac{1}{\gamma_Q} H, $$

$$0 = \eta \nabla^2 v - \nabla P + \nabla \cdot \sigma + f_g,$$

where the flow is assumed to be incompressible ($\nabla \cdot v = 0$). $A_{ij} = \dfrac{1}{2} (\partial_i v_j + \partial_j v_i ), \omega_{ij} = \dfrac{1}{2} (\partial_i v_j - \partial_j v_i )$ are the strain rate and the vorticity of the flow field respectively. The nematic molecular field, 
$$H_{ij} = a_Q \tilde{\phi} Q_{ij} + b_Q \rm{Tr}{Q^2} Q_{ij} + K_Q \nabla^2 Q_{ij},$$
is derived from a Landau-de Gennes free energy. With $\phi_0 = \sqrt{-a_\phi/b_\phi}, \tilde{\phi} = (1+\phi/\phi_0)/2$ is the volume fraction of the active phase.


The stress in the Stokes equation consists of the capillary stress ($\sigma^\phi$), elastic stress ($\sigma^e$) and the active stresses ($\sigma^a$) as:
$$\sigma_{ij}^\phi = -\hat{k_\phi} (\nabla_i \phi \nabla_j \phi - \frac12 \delta_{ij} (\nabla \phi)^2)$$
$$\sigma_{ij}^e = -\lambda H_{ij} + Q_{ik} H_{kj} - H_{ik}Q_{kj}$$
$$\sigma_{ij}^a = \alpha \tilde{\phi} Q_{ij}$$


## Transition from asymmetric interface fluctuations to active folding:
Representative snapshots of the steady state configuration of the phase field are shown here. Here the active phase ($\tilde{\phi}=1$) is shown in cyan and the passive phase ($\tilde{\phi}=0$) in black, for increasing activity at two different values of the interface surface tension

The figure captions have the parameter values listed in physical units (described in detail in the paper). To recreate these simulation results, use the default values included with the solver and set activtiy and phase field paramters as $\alpha^\rm{sim} = -|\alpha|/10$ and $-a_{\phi}^\rm{sim} = b_{\phi}^\rm{sim} =\gamma/10$ and $\kappa_\phi^\rm{sim} = \hat{\kappa_\phi}^\rm{sim} = 1.50 \times (\gamma/10)$.
